# TimeSync
It is a Web App for managing deals information and monitoring their activity. Deals are the information about a potential sale or opportunity.
We can create a sales pipeline and add some stages of it. Sales pipeline is a visual representation of the progress of the deals like in which stage they are.
A sales pipeline is a framework or visual representation that describes the stages a lead or deal goes through when interacting with a salesperson.
Stages are the phases through which a deal or lead goes through before it gets won or lost.
We can also send deal proposal to a person or an organization.
